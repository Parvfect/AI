Hey welcome.

The goal is to create the best chat agent in the world.
I am an absolute beginner though, so gonna fall and get back up and keep learning. 


Updates

25/10/20 - Shut up okay. I didn't update. I did some part of the MIT deep learning course (mostly theory) since I am in college now and I don't have a GPU for the labs (rip). But my next idea is to create a deep model for this dataset of allen poe's short stories. So yeah that's what I am going to do. Let's have fun watching me fail.

22/8/20 - So I have been spending some times refining my basics (CS61A - my friend is in Berkeley lmao), and didn't have much time to do ml. I am halfway through that but I really wanted to do ML so I decided to start doing the O'Reily book and it's not bad. So I'm on the first project of the housing model. It's quite in depth and helping me connect some dots. This is getting exciting.

2/7/20 - Learning tensorflow now, the same dataset I suppose.

28/6/20 - So I learnt how to switch to the gpu but will have to call off learning for a few days to transfer out data from my computer so I can boot it to Ubuntu.


26/6/20 - Yeah the abandoned catdog one was made. Its got a good accuracy on like 2 epochs so that's cool. Gonna learn how to switch to GPU now. refer - catdog.py


25/6/20 - Made a first number ocr using a MNIST dataset and Pytorch. Everything was done for me though, so looking forward to learning more. - refer to digitocr.py


24/6/20 - Some deep learning introduction and just some starter programs to understanding how a neural net works. Tried to make a cat dog one but gave up when the encoding differed and yeah, kinda lazy.

23/6/20 - Tried out a cosine similarity one to create the prereq.py, using some premade code. Gonna experiment with making the data file as big as possible. 
The bot is as good as the dataset though and its very random. Still want to use early input consideration. - refer to cossimbot.py
