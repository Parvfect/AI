Hey welcome.

The goal is to create the best chat agent in the world and I have some tricks up my sleeve to make it happen.
I am an absolute beginner though, so gonna fall and get back up and keep learning.

23/6/20 - Tried out a cosine similarity one to create the prereq.py, using some premade code. Gonna experiment with making the data file as big as possible. 
The bot is as good as the dataset though and its very random. Still want to use early input consideration.
